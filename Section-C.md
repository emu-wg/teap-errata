### C.1.  Successful Authentication

   The following exchanges show a successful TEAP authentication with
   basic password authentication and optional PAC refreshment.  The
   conversation will appear as follows:

       -------------------     -------------
                               <- EAP-Request/

       EAP-Response/
       Identity (MyID1) ->

                               <- EAP-Request/

                               (TEAP Start, S bit set, Authority-ID)

       EAP-Response/
       EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
       (TLS client_hello with
        PAC-Opaque in SessionTicket extension)->

                               <- EAP-Request/
                               EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                               (TLS server_hello,
                               (TLS change_cipher_spec,

       EAP-Response/

                              <- Basic-Password-Auth-Req TLV, Challenge

       Basic-Password-Auth-Resp TLV, Response with both
       username and password) ->

       optional additional exchanges (new pin mode,
       password change, etc.) ...

                            <-  Intermediate-Result-TLV (Success),
                                Crypto-Binding TLV (Request),
                                Result TLV (Success),
                                (Optional PAC TLV)
       
       Intermediate-Result-TLV (Success),
       Crypto-Binding TLV(Response),
       Result TLV (Success),
       (PAC-Acknowledgement TLV) ->

       TLS channel torn down
       (messages sent in cleartext)

                               <- EAP-Success

### C.2.  Failed Authentication

   The following exchanges show a failed TEAP authentication due to
   wrong user credentials.  The conversation will appear as follows:

       Authenticating Peer     Authenticator
       -------------------     -------------
                               <- EAP-Request/Identity

       EAP-Response/
       Identity (MyID1) ->


                               <- EAP-Request/
                               EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                               (TEAP Start, S bit set, Authority-ID)

       EAP-Response/
       EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
       (TLS client_hello with
        PAC-Opaque in SessionTicket extension)->

                               <- EAP-Request/
                               EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                               (TLS server_hello,
                               (TLS change_cipher_spec,
                                TLS finished)

       EAP-Response/
       EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1 ->
       (TLS change_cipher_spec,
        TLS finished)

       TLS channel established
       (messages sent within the TLS channel)

                              <- Basic-Password-Auth-Req TLV, Challenge

       Basic-Password-Auth-Resp TLV, Response with both
       username and password) ->

                               <- Intermediate-Result-TLV (Failure),
                                  Result TLV (Failure)

       Intermediate-Result-TLV (Failure),
       Result TLV (Failure) ->

       TLS channel torn down
       (messages sent in cleartext)

                               <- EAP-Failure

### C.3.  Full TLS Handshake Using Certificate-Based Ciphersuite

   In the case within TEAP Phase 1 where an abbreviated TLS handshake is
   tried, fails, and falls back to the certificate-based full TLS
   handshake, the conversation will appear as follows:

      Authenticating Peer    Authenticator
      -------------------    -------------
                             <- EAP-Request/Identity
      EAP-Response/
      Identity (MyID1) ->

      // Identity sent in the clear.  May be a hint to help route
         the authentication request to EAP server, instead of the
         full user identity.

                              <- EAP-Request/
                              EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                              (TEAP Start, S bit set, Authority-ID)
      EAP-Response/
      EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
      (TLS client_hello with
      PAC-Opaque in SessionTicket extension)->

      // Peer sends PAC-Opaque of Tunnel PAC along with a list of
         ciphersuites supported.  If the server rejects the PAC-
         Opaque, it falls through to the full TLS handshake.

                              <- EAP-Request/
                              EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                              (TLS server_hello,
                               TLS certificate,
                              [TLS server_key_exchange,]
                              [TLS certificate_request,]
                               TLS server_hello_done)

      EAP-Response/
      EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
      ([TLS certificate,]
       TLS client_key_exchange,
      [TLS certificate_verify,]
       TLS change_cipher_spec,
       TLS finished) ->
                              <- EAP-Request/
                              EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                              (TLS change_cipher_spec,
                               TLS finished,
                               EAP-Payload-TLV[EAP-Request/
                               Identity])

      // TLS channel established
         (messages sent within the TLS channel)

      // First EAP Payload TLV is piggybacked to the TLS Finished as
         Application Data and protected by the TLS tunnel.

      EAP-Payload-TLV
      [EAP-Response/Identity (MyID2)]->

      // identity protected by TLS.

                               <- EAP-Payload-TLV
                               [EAP-Request/EAP-Type=X]

      EAP-Payload-TLV
      [EAP-Response/EAP-Type=X] ->

      // Method X exchanges followed by Protected Termination

                           <- Intermediate-Result-TLV (Success),
                               Crypto-Binding TLV (Request),
                               Result TLV (Success)

      Intermediate-Result-TLV (Success),
      Crypto-Binding TLV (Response),
      Result-TLV (Success) ->

      // TLS channel torn down
      (messages sent in cleartext)

                              <- EAP-Success

### C.4.  Client Authentication during Phase 1 with Identity Privacy

   In the case where a certificate-based TLS handshake occurs within
   TEAP Phase 1 and client certificate authentication and identity
   privacy is desired (and therefore TLS renegotiation is being used to
   transmit the peer credentials in the protected TLS tunnel), the
   conversation will appear as follows:

      Authenticating Peer     Authenticator
      -------------------     -------------
                             <- EAP-Request/Identity
      EAP-Response/
      Identity (MyID1) ->

      // Identity sent in the clear.  May be a hint to help route
         the authentication request to EAP server, instead of the
         full user identity.

                              <- EAP-Request/
                              EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                              (TEAP Start, S bit set, Authority-ID)
      EAP-Response/
      EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
      (TLS client_hello)->
                              <- EAP-Request/
                              EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                              (TLS server_hello,
                               TLS certificate,
                              [TLS server_key_exchange,]
                              [TLS certificate_request,]
                               TLS server_hello_done)
      EAP-Response/
      EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
      (TLS client_key_exchange,
       TLS change_cipher_spec,
       TLS finished) ->
                              <- EAP-Request/
                              EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
                              (TLS change_cipher_spec,
                               TLS finished,
                               EAP-Payload-TLV[EAP-Request/
                               Identity])

      // TLS channel established
         (EAP Payload messages sent within the TLS channel)

      // peer sends TLS client_hello to request TLS renegotiation

      TLS client_hello ->

                              <- TLS server_hello,
                               TLS certificate,
                               [TLS server_key_exchange,]
                               [TLS certificate_request,]
                               TLS server_hello_done
      [TLS certificate,]
       TLS client_key_exchange,
      [TLS certificate_verify,]
       TLS change_cipher_spec,
       TLS finished ->

                              <- TLS change_cipher_spec,
                                 TLS finished,
                                 Crypto-Binding TLV (Request),
                                 Result TLV (Success)

      Crypto-Binding TLV (Response),
      Result-TLV (Success)) ->

      //TLS channel torn down
      (messages sent in cleartext)

                              <- EAP-Success

### C.5.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   In the case where TEAP fragmentation is required, the conversation
   will appear as follows:

      Authenticating Peer     Authenticator
      -------------------     -------------
                              <- EAP-Request/

                              [TLS certificate_request,]
                               TLS server_hello_done)
                              (Fragment 1: L, M bits set)

      EAP-Response/

      EAP-Response/
      EAP-Type=TEAP, V=1
      ([TLS certificate,]
       TLS client_key_exchange,
      [TLS certificate_verify,]
       TLS change_cipher_spec,
       TLS finished)
       (Fragment 1: L, M bits set)->

                               TLS finished,
                              [EAP-Payload-TLV[
                              EAP-Request/Identity]])

      // TLS channel established
         (messages sent within the TLS channel)

      // First EAP Payload TLV is piggybacked to the TLS Finished as
         Application Data and protected by the TLS tunnel.

      EAP-Payload-TLV
      [EAP-Response/Identity (MyID2)]->

      // identity protected by TLS.

                               <- EAP-Payload-TLV
                               [EAP-Request/EAP-Type=X]

                              <- EAP-Success

### C.6.  Sequence of EAP Methods

   When TEAP is negotiated with a sequence of EAP method X followed by
   method Y, the conversation will occur as follows:

### C.7.  Failed Crypto-Binding

   The following exchanges show a failed crypto-binding validation.  The
   conversation will appear as follows:

### C.8.  Sequence of EAP Method with Vendor-Specific TLV Exchange

   When TEAP is negotiated with a sequence of EAP methods followed by a

### C.9.  Peer Requests Inner Method after Server Sends Result TLV

   In the case where the peer is authenticated during Phase 1 and the
   server sends back a Result TLV but the peer wants to request another
   inner method, the conversation will appear as follows:
